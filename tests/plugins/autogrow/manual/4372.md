1. Focus inside editable window.
2. Add or remove extra lines to force editor resize.
3. Observe editor width.

The editor should have constant width. Only height is changing according to vertical amount of content.

#### Unexpected result:
With each vertical resize editor is shrinking for about margins + paddings.
